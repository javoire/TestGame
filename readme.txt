jMonkeyEngine 3 test game

Notes to self:
- using heightmaps for terrain
* create in blender with blend-texture
* create rgb-alphamap in blender
* render with orthogonal 512x512 camera in top view

- If textures go black in blender, try:
* flipping normals in edit mode or
* checking/unchecking premultiply on every texture

- alphatextures:
* use png with alphachannel to make it work with shadowrenderer
