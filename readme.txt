jMonkeyEngine 3 test game

Notes to self:
- jmonkey can't convert .blend -> .j3o with to highpoly objects.
* solution, ??
* trying with heightmaps. still jagged steps in landscape. try 16bit?

- If textures go black in blender, try:
* flipping normals in edit mode or
* checking/unchecking premultiply on every texture
