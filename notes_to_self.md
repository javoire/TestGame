# Notes to self

## Blender

Set shading to "smooth" in edit mode to get smooth shading in jmonkey
! Sometimes setting shading to smooth will make the loadAsset(blenderfilepath..) to just freeze when launching the game.... 
!! It doesn't feeze, just takes ages to load .blend file

When adding new assets OR updating existing ones, don't forget to refresh folders in eclipse! (otherwise AssetNotFoundException or new changes won't show)
